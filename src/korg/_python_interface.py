    """Creates a synthetic spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Teff
        The effective temperature (in units of Kelvin)
    logg
        The surface gravity in cgs units
    M_H
        The metallicity or [metals/H] (the default is 0.0). In more detail,
        this is the log₁₀ solar-relative abundance of elements heavier than He.
        This argument effectively sets default abundances that can be
        overridden, on a per-element basis, by the ``alpha_H`` argument and
        the ``**abundances`` keyword arguments.
    alpha_H
        The alpha enhancement, [α/H] (the default is the value of ``M_H``). In
        more detail, this specifies the log₁₀ solar-relative abundances that
        override the abundances set by ``M_H`` for each alpha element
        ({default_alpha_elements}). These abundances can be overridden by the
        ``**abundances`` keyword arguments.
    linelist
        A linelist
    wavelengths
        A tuple of the start and end wavelengths (default ia (5000, 6000)), or
        a sequence of ``(λstart, λstop)`` pairs. The values have units of
        angstroms.
    rectify
        Whether to rectify (continuum normalize) the spectrum (default is true).
    R
        The resolution. The default is ``float("inf")``, which means that no
        LSF (line spread function) is applied. ``R`` can be a scalar, or a
        function that maps a wavelength (in Å) to resolving power.
    vsini
        Projected rotational velocity in km/s (default is 0).
    vmic
        microturbulent velocity in km/s (default is 1.0).
    **abundances
        These keyword arguments can be any atomic symbol (e.g. ``Fe`` or ``C``)
        can be used to specify a (solar relative, [``X``/H]) abundance. These
        override ``M_H`` and ``alpha_H``. Specifying an individual abundance
        means that the true metallicity and alpha will not correspond precisely
        to the values of ``M_H`` and ``alpha_H``. This is the only way to
        specify a non-solar abundance of He.

    Returns
    -------
    wls: array
        A 1D array of wavelengths (in units of angstroms) at which the
        spectrum was synthesized
    rectified_flux: array
        A 1D array, with the same shape as ``wls``, that the rectified
        output spectrum. The array holds unitless values between 0 and 1.
    continuum
        A 1D array, with the same shape as ``wls``, that holds the raw
        continuum spectrum (i.e. it is the spectrum without lines in the
        linelist and the Hydrogen lines). These values have units of
        erg/s/cm^4/Å. Be aware that these values:

        - aren't affected by the LSF (see the ``R`` argument)
        - don't account for stellar rotation (see the ``vsini`` parameter) or
          limb darkening

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    synthesize_kwargs, format_A_X_kwargs
        dicts of additional keyword arguments that are respectively forwarded
        to the ``Korg.synthesize`` and ``Korg.format_A_X`` julia functions.

    .. warning::

       Be aware that:

       1. These kwargs are for advanced users
       2. Misusing them will result in cryptic error messages
       3. If you are thinking about using them, you should consider using
          ``juliacall`` directly or switching to julia
       4. We reserve the right to change the expected types of kwargs
          corresponding to Julia types without obvious analogous python
          types, at any time (e.g. between patch versions).

    #    python property, `arr = np.array(vec, copy=False)` makes `arr` reference
    #    a ndarray instance that
    #    - reuses the memory of the underlying julia vector tracked within the python
    #      object that `vec` references
    #    - properly tracks a reference to the python variable `vec` references. Thus:
    #      - if `vec` goes out of scope before `arr`, the object previously referenced
    #        by `vec` will be kept alive by a reference held in `arr`.
    #      - a reference to the python object holding the julia vector is obviously
    #        stored in any other numpy arrays that are created that view the underlying
    #        memory referenced by `arr`
    #      - you can see this reference by looking at `arr.base`. At the time of
    #        writing, `arr.base` technically references a `memoryview` that references
    #        `juliacall.VectorValue` python object. You can see this by looking at
    #        `arr.base.obj`
    # -> It's **ALMOST CERTAINLY** a really good thing that we essentially "forget"
    #    that these buffers are implemented as mutable vectors as we convert them to
    #    numpy arrays. Problems would probably arise if we changed vector capacity
    #    (i.e. we started adding items):
    #    - AFAIK, the only plausible way to provide an arbitrary capacity vector with
    #      contiguous memory, is to realloc when we need more capacity. The new memory
    #      allocation is probably at a different memory address and I'm pretty sure
    #      that there isn't machinery to communicate the change to numpy/python.
    #      Consequently the numpy array will hold a dangling pointer.
    #    - even if the pointer to the reallocated memory kept the same address, I
    #      suspect that pointer provenance issues could hypothetically arise...
    #    - this is something that comes up a lot when using C++'s std::vector
    # -> It's worth noting that it would be better if we could just pass the output
    #    buffers directly to Korg.jl.
    #    - But, that would realistically take a lot of work and this solution is
    #      probably "good enough." This approach is better than doing a memcpy and is
    #      probably only an issue when memory is limited
    #    - The limitation here relates to "how delayed" memory freeing is... When the
    #      last reference to a numpy array goes out of scope, we need to:
    #      1. wait for the python garbage collector to run (& reduce the ref count for
    #         the memory view), garbage collect the memory view (& reduce the ref count
    #         for the `juliacall.VectorValue` python object, and collect
    #         `juliacall.VectorValue` python object. (I guess it's plausible this
