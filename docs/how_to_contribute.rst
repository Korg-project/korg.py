How to Contribute
=================

pyKorg is a community project that is developed out in the open!

Everybody Can Contribute
------------------------

We welcome contributions from anybody! There are various ways you can contribute. For example, you can introduce new code, you can improve the documentation, or you can contribute new examples. Development takes place on GitHub. So you can look for open issues and open pull requests there.

We also welcome GitHub issues that report errors of any kind (whether its code bugs, errors in the documentation, or just a comments about things that you think are missing from the documentation).

If you are interested in contributing, you may want to get in touch, just so we can make sure that multiple are not duplicating efforts.

.. important::

   pyKorg is intended to be a wrapper of the Korg.jl Julia Package.

   - Consequently, development of new core functionality (e.g. adding logic to model new physics) generally takes place there.

   - With that said, we welcome any contributions that makes pyKorg more ergonomic or that expose more functionality from the underlying Korg.jl Julia Package.

   - We are also happy to consider contributions that make pyKorg easier to use with external tools.

   - If you have an idea in mind to improve pyKorg, and you aren't sure which category it falls into, you can always ask!

Licensing
---------

pyKorg is licensed under the 3-clause BSD license. Consequently, all contributed code must also use the same license (or at least be compatible).

How to actually contribute?
---------------------------
pyKorg development makes use of Git and GitHub. If you aren't familiar with these tools, we recommend that you read some of the `excellent guides provided by GitHub <https://docs.github.com/en>`__.

All pyKorg code is generally formatted. But, please don't be intimidated by that. The repository is configured so that you don't need to install anything on your machine. Our :ref:`Code Formatting Guide <code-formatting>` provides more guidance.
